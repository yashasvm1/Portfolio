# Summary 

The topic for my final story was “Is it a good time to invest in a house in California?”.  This story talks about how has been the California house market performing, what are the factors involved in deciding whether or not to invest in a house and then providing a conclusion based on the data. For this project I used data from Zillow and Morningstar. 


# Taking the insights from part 2

1) Focussing on a specific problem: This was a big learning from part 2 because although I got a good reaction on the visualtions my auideoce didn’t have any key takeaway from the story so it was very important to narrow down the focus and give a tangible outcome to the audience. 

2) Including more visualisations than just bar graphs: I included the US graph in the presentation to make the presentation more engaging for the audience. Bar graphs and line graphs give a good perspective to the audience but it is also good to add other types of chart to make the story more engaging for audience 

# What motivated me to work on this story?

I was motivated to work on this story because I am in my final semester and buying a house is one of my next goals. Since investing in a house is a big financial decision, requires in-depth research and consideration. I started with the housing prices in the US and then decided to narrow my focus as I went ahead in the process. During my interviews, I realized that giving a direction to my study is important so that there are more tangible learnings from the article. One of the ways to give it a direction was to focus on a particular state and for this project I focussed California for two main reasons:

1) Most of the students graduating from CMU move to California because of the tech industry 
2) The housing market in California has always been in news because of the high prices. 


# Audience 

The target audience for the story is: 
1) Anyone who is planning to buy a house in California
2) Students who are planning to move to California and considering purchasing a house 



# What steps did I take to write the story?

1) The first thing I did to get an understanding of the market I did my primary research on how the house market doing currently, what are the factors that impact the house prices, read articles by experts 
2) Talking with my relatives who have considered buying a house or bought a house to get an understanding on what are the different factors that are important while making this decision 

# Design Decisions
1) Using a light background so that the text on the page is visible to the readers. Initially I used a background colour which made it difficult the text to read and then moved to backgrounds to make it easier for the reader to read
2) Highlighting the parts which are important for the user using a different color. For example, in my bar charts I used red colour to highlight the mortgage rates are very high in California as compared to the other month

# Challenges faced and how could I have done differently

1) It was very difficult for me to narrow down the scope of my project. I started with a topic which I am not really aware about. It took time in understanding the topic and then coming up with some insights. The way I could have done it better is by taking a topic I have some previous experience. For example, I started with the housing prices in US and narrowed it down to is it a good time to buy a house in california to give the story a direction and conclusion. 

2) The other big challenge was to create a flow in the story. It took me a long time to create a logical flow in the story. One thing I could have done better is to conduct more directed storytelling sessions before starting the wireframes



# Things learned: 

1) People don’t just want to see numbers, they want a story. In order to engage an audience in a story it is necessary to build a flow and have a takeaway for the audience.
2) Less is more: Keeping your charts and story less complicated makes it easier for the audience to understand. If your audience is taking more than 30 seconds to understand a chart than it is time to make it better.
