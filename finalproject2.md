Introduction

Hello! Thank you for your time and help with this project. My name is    Yashasvi Modi     and I am one of the students in a  data visualization course this semester. I will be asking you some questions about a project I am working on and if I see other interesting things as we are discussing, I may ask more questions if that is ok with you.
(Mention confidentiality + recording)

You can stop your participation at any point during the interview. We would like to ask for your permission to video and audio record our interview and conversation. All the data and recorded information will be confidential and anonymous. We will use this data within the class only and for project purposes in the course only. We are not evaluating you or your work, this interview is for the purpose of learning more about travel planning. Is it ok for us to record?
