# United States Debt-to-GDP comparison with neighbouring countries

The debt-to-GDP ratio is the metric comparing a country's public debt to its gross domestic product (GDP). The graph below shows how the debt to gdp ratio of United States has changed from 2003-2019 as compared to it's neighbouring countries. The line in pink is United States and rest are in grey. I did this visualisation to make the graph more focussed on a topic and have a key takeway. To show the comparison I muted the other countries in the graph and highlighted the performance of united states.

# Different methods of visualisations 

Differnt visualisation methods have different agenda. Before deciding what visualisation method to use oit is frist important to decide what is the message that we want to deliver from our visualisations. In this example, we have used a bar chart to show the debt-GDP ratio for different countries in 2021 and a grid chart to show the trend of the debt-ratio over years across different countries. In the third visualisation the focus is narrow and I have used line chart to compare the performance of four different countries over time. 

The visualization method also changes with the audience as some audience like school going kids will be able to understand a bar chart easier then a grid chart. So it is important to keep the audience in mind when decking on which visualisation to use.
